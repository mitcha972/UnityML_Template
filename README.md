# ðŸ§  Unity ML Template


## Overview

**Unity ML Template** is a clean and customizable starting point for building machine learning environments using [Unity ML-Agents](https://unity.com/products/machine-learning-agents). Whether you're prototyping a new environment, training agents in a custom simulation, or exploring reinforcement learning, this template provides a ready-to-use Unity project structure, integrated ML-Agents setup, and helpful baseline components.

> **Compatible with ML-Agents Release 19+**

## Getting Started

1. Install the [Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) (Release 19 or later).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the Unity project via Unity Hub:  
   `Unity Hub â†’ Projects â†’ Add â†’ Select the root folder`.
4. Set up a Python virtual environment (3.10):  
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv venv
   ```
5. Activate the Env 
   ```bash
   \venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
6. Install the required Python packages:  
   Follow the installation guide here:

## Environment Setup

- Open Unity and load the project.
- Make sure ML-Agents package is properly imported.
- Check `Project Settings â†’ Player â†’ API Compatibility Level` and ensure it's compatible with ML-Agents.

## Training Agents

1. Activate your virtual environment (where `ml-agents` is installed).
2. Create or modify a YAML config file for training (see the `config/` folder for examples).
3. Run the training command:  
   ```bash
   mlagents-learn <path-to-config> --run-id=<your_run_id> --time-scale=1
   ```
